If you're using Ionic 3 (check the package.json  file to find out which version you're using), you'll need to add the HttpModule  
to your imports[]  array in the AppModule  to get Http functionality to work.

Don't forget to also add the import statement to the top of the AppModule file:

import { HttpModule } from '@angular/http'; 

You can stop at this point if you're using Angular up to version 5 (the latest version until now).

-------

When using Angular 5+, you can also use the new HttpClient  it offers (this will be mandatory once Angular 6 is released).

Here's how you use it:

import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http'  

instead of

import { HttpModule } from '@angular/http'; 

Hence, you should add HttpClientModule  to imports[]  in your AppModule  (instead of HttpModule  as described above).

In the files where you inject Http , you should now inject HttpClient .

To get access to this type/ class, you have to change the import from

import { Http } from '@angular/http'; 

to

import { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http'; 

Generally, you use HttpClient  in exactly the same way, though one change is required: HttpClient  extracts the data you 
get with the response automatically. Hence you don't need to map()  it manually anymore.

So the following code

this.http.get('my-url').map(res => res.json()) 

will become

this.http.get('my-url') 

That's it. With these steps, you're using the new HttpClient and everything should work just as shown in the videos!
